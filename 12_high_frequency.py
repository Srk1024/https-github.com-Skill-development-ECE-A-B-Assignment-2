"""
High frequency
Given a list of integers nums, find the most frequently occurring
element and return the number of occurrences of that element.

For example, given the list [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1],
return 5 since the the element 1 appears 5 times.

Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1]

Output
5

Example 2
Input
nums = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Output
7

Example 3
Input
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Output
1
